# Travel-App

## About Project : 
This is last project of udacity's course in I build a travel app and pull basic data from an API.The project will include a simple form where one enter the location he/she is traveling to and the date of leaving. If the trip is within a week, one will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, user will get a predicted forecast.

## Followings things have benn achived in the project: 
- [x] The project meets specific file structure as required.
- [x] Webpack config should contain at least 3 scripts, express server, build and test. Additionally, dev server may be included
- [x] There should be at least one test for the express server and application javascript.
- [x] The project must have service workers installed.
- [x] All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
- [x] Styling is set up in a logical way. All interactive elements have hover states.
- [x] HTML structure should be indented properly with classes and IDâ€™s that make sense.
- [x] The design should clearly be different from other Udacity Projects..
- [x] Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
